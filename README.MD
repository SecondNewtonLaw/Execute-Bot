# Execute Bot

Not Tested? Not tested.
Written with the most strange way possible? Yes.
Needed to exist? No.

NOTE:
    You WILL need a file named `TOKEN` in the root of the executable containing the Token of the bot.<br>
    A `PASSWORD` file which contains the user password, which is used to run files with the `sudo` command.
